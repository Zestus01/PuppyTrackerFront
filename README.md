# 03/15/23 I am aware of an issue with logging/creating users. Should be fixed by 03/16/23 afternoon

## Live Product: https://health-hound.web.app

## Backend Repository: https://github.com/Zestus01/PuppyTrackerBack

## About:
### Planned, designed, and coded a full stack application to track a dogâ€™s daily activities. Front end was implemented with function based React components. Back end was constructed using the Django rest framework. Users can keep track of four different activities: food, bathroom, walk, and playtime. Users can also have multiple dogs with the application, and view a variety of trend charts. Utilized external NPM to display the trend charts, handle input errors, and various CSS effects. For demo purposes use admin for the username and password. Activities can be entered but nothing can be deleted.  
#### Small features I'm proud of: 
1. Submitting an activity is autofilled depending on what you click. Dropdown menu still allows user to switch activities to submit.
2. Using the npm package React-charts, and charts.js to allow user to view weight over time, activity count, and playtime vs walks. 
3. Options for activity submit is filled in from the backend.
